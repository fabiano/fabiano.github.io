# Runaways by Rainbow Rowell & Andrés Genolet Vol. 4: But You Can't Hide

We have Molly. We have Gert. We have Doombot back. We have another great volume.

I have been loving Rainbow Rowell's work on Runaways. In the previous volumes I was worried about her bringing back The Pride/Gibborim plot, I don't want to read the same story over and over, but she is so good writing the characters and their relationship.

It is as good as Vaughan's work but more actual/modern.

This time Kris Anka is replaced by Andrés Genolet on the pencils and what a great artist he is too.
