# Mutts - CÃ£es, Gatos e Outros Bichos by Patrick McDonnell

A small but fun collection of Mutt stories by Patrick McDonnell in Brazilian Portuguese.

I was sad that this was the only collection in Portuguese but found The Art of Nothing: 25 Years of Mutts and the Art of Patrick McDonnell book on Amazon and had to add it to my wishlist.
