# Wonder Woman: Earth One Volume 1 by Grant Morrison and Yanick Paquette

Another Wonder Woman reimagination, this time written by Grant Morrison and with drawings by Yanick Paquette.

It was a fun read, but I felt uncomfortable with the art.

I have to say that I was impressed at first by how sexy Diana and the Amazons were drawn. After some pages, it was taking my attention away from the book, and I was not sure if I was reading a comic book or a pin-up magazine.

Still, if you are curious about how Grant Morrison would reimagine the Wonder Woman, it's worth a shot.
