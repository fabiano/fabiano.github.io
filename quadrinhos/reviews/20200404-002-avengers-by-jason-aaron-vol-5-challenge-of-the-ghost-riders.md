# Avengers by Jason Aaron Vol. 5: Challenge Of The Ghost Riders

Here we have the Avengers helping Robbie Reyes to get rid of his Spirit of Vengeance.

Jason Aaron's Avengers has been a disappointment for me. After his Thor run, my expectations were high. The stories aren't bad, but they aren't what I wanted to see on an Avengers book.

I only keep buying it because I want to see how everything is going to connect to the Avengers of 1,000,000 B.C. storyline.
