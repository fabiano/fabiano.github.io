# On A Sunbean by Tillie Walden

I have to say that I wasn't impressed by the first chapters but then the story grew on me that I wasn't able to stop reading it. When I was near the end of the book I was wishing that everything ends well for the characters.

Lovely story with nice characters and an interesting universe. By the way, I'd love to see Tillie exploring more this universe.

I only have one complaint about this edition: the lettering. The font is too small and sometimes it wasn't clear who was speaking the dialogs.
