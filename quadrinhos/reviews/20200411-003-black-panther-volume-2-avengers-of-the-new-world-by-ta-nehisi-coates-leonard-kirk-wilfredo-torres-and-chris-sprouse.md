# Black Panther Volume 2: Avengers of the New World by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Leonard Kirk, Wilfredo Torres, and Chris Sprouse

In the continuation of Coates's work, we have a shift of focus from the Wakandan politics to their gods (or absent gods).

T'Challa and Shuri have to deal with old gods, the Wakandan people losing faith in the Orishas, and the return of an old enemy.

Talking about returns, Ororo is back and plays a big role in the stories.

I wanted to see more about the political changes that started in the previous volume, but Coates develops the plot around the gods so well that after the first issues I was hooked.

I can't imagine someone else writing the Black Panther soon. And I would love to see him writing an Ororo solo comic book.

Wakanda forever!
