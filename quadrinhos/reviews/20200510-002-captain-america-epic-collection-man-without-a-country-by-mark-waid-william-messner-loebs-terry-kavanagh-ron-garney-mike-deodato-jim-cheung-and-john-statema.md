# Captain America Epic Collection: Man Without a Country by Mark Waid, William Messner-Loebs, Terry Kavanagh, Ron Garney, Mike Deodato, Jim Cheung, and John Statema

I was looking forward to reading this Epic Collection. Everybody says good things about Mark Waid's work on Captain America.

So, I'm disappointed with everybody. I disliked stories and art. His first arc, with the return of Captain America by the hands of one of his big enemies was the worst.

Seeing Captain America team up with this enemy affected the entire reading for me. You cannot team up Captain America with a nazi. There is no plot where this could be acceptable.

Happy to have skipped the omnibus when it was released.
