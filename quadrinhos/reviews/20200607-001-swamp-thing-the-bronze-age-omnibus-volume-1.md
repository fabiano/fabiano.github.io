# Swamp Thing: The Bronze Age Omnibus Volume 1 by Len Wein, Bernie Wrightson, Nestor Redondo, Martin Pasko, Tom Yeates, Stephen Bissette, John Totleben and more

I was looking forward to reading this omnibus, but after a few issues, I had to fight myself to not drop it.

The beginning is really good, with Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson's early stories, but I grew tired of the format and plot of the stories. The same cannot be said about the art. This book has some amazing panels by Bernie Wrightson and the other artists.

So I'd only recommend it if you are a bronze age collector or want to read the Swamp Thing early adventures.
