# The Authority Omnibus by Warren Ellis, Bryan Hitch, Mark Millar, Tom Peyer, Paul Neary, Frank Quitely, and Dustin Nguyen

My initial plan was to read only the initial Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch issues and come back to finish the Uncanny X-Men Omnibus. But these first 12 issues are so good that I was not able to stop until I finished the whole thing.

The Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch run is one of my favorite superhero comic books of all time.

The characters, the way they are introduced, their development, the plot of the stories, the art. It is all near perfection to me. There are so many pages drawn by Bryan Hitch on these issues that I want to frame and hang on my office walls.

Then we have the run by Mark Millar, Tom Peyer, Frank Quitely, and Dustin Nguyen. Is it as good as the Ellis/Hitch run? No, but it is quite close to it.

If you want to see superheroes changing the world, stopping invasions from parallel realities, and fighting a cybernetically-enhanced hillbilly this is a comic book you must read.
