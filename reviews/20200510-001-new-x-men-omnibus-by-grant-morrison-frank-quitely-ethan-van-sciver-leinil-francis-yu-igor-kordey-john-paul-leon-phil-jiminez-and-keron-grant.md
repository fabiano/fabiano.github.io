# New X-Men Omnibus by Grant Morrison, Frank Quitely, Ethan Van Sciver, Leinil Francis Yu, Igor Kordey, John Paul Leon, Phil Jiminez, and Keron Grant

When I try to remember where I started reading X-Men comics, The Twelve saga is the first thing that comes to my mind, but Morrison's era was the first time that I enjoyed each issue.

His wild ideas, the new look, the greatness. He made me start to pay attention to the name of writers and artists behind a comic book.

Re-reading has only made me like it more. Cassandra Nova, Quentin Quire, Cuckoos, Beak. So many good characters. What about his work with Emma Frost? My favorite character in his entire arc.

The match of the artists with the weirdness of the stories is another thing that made me like it more.

Such a great book that I recommend any X-Men fan.
