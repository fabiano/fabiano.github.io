# Uncanny X-Men Omnibus Volume 3 by Chris Claremont, Dave Cockrum, Paul Smith, Frank Miller, Brent Anderson, Bill Sienkiewicz, Walter Simonson, and John Romita Jr.

One of my favorite omnibuses so far. The first two volumes are great, but this is near perfection.

We have Belasco kidnapping Illyana, Brood Saga, X-Men fighting Dracula, Morlocks' first appearance, Wolverine in Japan, and his wedding to Mariko.

You will also see the first appearance of the Storm's punk look and Madelyne Prior, Rogue joining the team, and Carol Danvers becoming Binary.

These are all great stories, but they are nothing compared to God Loves, Man Kills. It is only the best graphic novel that I have ever read and a must-read for any comic book reader in my humble opinion.

What about the pencilers? We have the superb art of Dave Cockrum. Paul Smith's great work on the Morlocks (loved his Callisto). Bill Sienkiewicz's Storm on the Uncanny X-Men Annual left me breathless. Wolverine by Frank Miller.

This is my definitive X-Men book. If you want to start reading X-Men, this is the book you should get.
