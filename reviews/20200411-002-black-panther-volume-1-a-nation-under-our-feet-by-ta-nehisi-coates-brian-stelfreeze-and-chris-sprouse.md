# Black Panther Volume 1: A Nation Under Our Feet by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Brian Stelfreeze, and Chris Sprouse

These first twelve issues written by Coates are really good.

We have T'Challa dealing with the consequences of the latest attacks on Wakanda, of being more a superhero than a king in the eyes of the Wakandan people, and a revolution started by new enemies and old friends.

There is politics,  there is Wakandan culture, and there is a super-hero team-up with Ororo and Misty Knight 😍

Wakanda forever!
