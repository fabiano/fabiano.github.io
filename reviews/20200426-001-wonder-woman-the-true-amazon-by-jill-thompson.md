# Wonder Woman: The True Amazon by Jill Thompson

It was a good surprise this reimagination of the Wonder Woman's origin by Jill Thompson.

I was afraid of reading another origin story, but I was so involved that I finished it without even noticing it.

Presenting Diana as a spoiled kid and showing how this led her to become the Wonder Woman was a fresh take on her origin.

The painted art is good and matches the storybook-style of the book.
