# Batman: The Dark Knight Saga Deluxe Edition by Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, and Lynn Varley

Dark Knight Returns was one of my first graphic novels when I was getting into comics. At the beginning of the year, I saw that the pages of the edition I bought in 2006 were turning yellow and decided to upgrade it.

The Deluxe Edition collects the two first parts of the Dark Knight saga:

The Dark Knight Returns a must-read for any comic book fan and one of Frank Miller's best stories.

The Dark Knight Strikes Back the continuation of the first graphic novel. It's not as good as the first part, but we have Frank Miller drawing Wonder Woman, so I will say it is worth the money.

It also includes character sketches and script pages.
